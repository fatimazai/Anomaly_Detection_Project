ðŸ§  Credit Card Fraud Detection (Unsupervised Learning)

ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to detect anomalous (potentially fraudulent) transactions in a highly imbalanced credit card dataset.
Since labels were hidden during training, the models learned normal transaction behavior and later evaluated on real fraud labels.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview
The dataset contains anonymized transaction features (`V1â€“V28`), along with `Amount`, `Time`, and a hidden `Class` label indicating fraud (1) or legitimate (0).  
The focus is on **detecting rare frauds** in highly imbalanced data.

ðŸ§° Technologies Used
Python 3.10+
Libraries:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly,
scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras

ðŸ“Š Key Models
Isolation Forest:
Achieved low-to-medium precision and low recall. It primarily detects strong statistical outliers but may miss subtle fraud patterns.
One-Class SVM:
Performed similarly to Isolation Forest but showed slightly better recall. It is more sensitive to how features are scaled and can capture marginally finer distinctions.
Autoencoder:
Provided moderate precision but the best recall among the models. Its neural network structure allows it to learn complex, non-linear relationships, making it better at identifying subtle anomalies.
